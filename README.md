This repository contains files for bars, holders and other 3d parts for imaging and electrophysiology.

The designs were created in FreeCAD - an open source design software.

These designs are currently being tested in the Churchland Lab by Joao Couto and Marsa Taheri.

### Holder for imaging and electrophysiology

This holder can be fabricated in stainless steel and is currently (September 2020) being tested for imaging.

The holes are designed to be treaded for 8-32 screws and 1mm post implants.
